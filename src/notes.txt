Common hibernate configurations

1 - spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update/create/validate/create-drop/none
    ddl - data definition language. It contains commands like create, alter, drop etc. which can be used to define or modify database structure.
    update - It will update the database schema according to the entity classes without dropping any existing data.
    create - It will create the database schema according to the entity classes, dropping any existing data.
    validate - It will validate the database schema against the entity classes, throwing an error if there are discrepancies.
    create-drop - It will create the database schema according to the entity classes at application startup and drop it when the application shuts down.
    none - No action will be performed on the database schema.

    In production environments, it's common to use 'validate' or 'none' to prevent accidental data loss.
    we should avoid using 'create' or 'create-drop' in production as they can lead to data loss.

2 - spring.jpa.show-sql=true/false
    This property controls whether Hibernate will log the SQL statements it generates to the console.
    true - SQL statements will be logged to the console.
    false - SQL statements will not be logged.
    This is useful for debugging and understanding the queries being executed by Hibernate.

3 - spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true/false
    This property controls whether the SQL statements logged to the console are formatted for better readability.
    true - SQL statements will be formatted with line breaks and indentation.
    false - SQL statements will be logged in a single line without formatting.
    This is particularly useful when 'spring.jpa.show-sql' is set to true, as it makes the logged SQL easier to read and understand.

4 - spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.DialectClass
    This property specifies the SQL dialect that Hibernate should use to communicate with the database.
    The dialect determines how Hibernate generates SQL queries for a specific database.
    Examples of dialect classes:
    - org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect for MySQL databases.
    - org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect for PostgreSQL databases.
    - org.hibernate.dialect.OracleDialect for Oracle databases.
    - org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServerDialect for Microsoft SQL Server databases.
    Specifying the correct dialect is important for ensuring that Hibernate generates compatible SQL for the target database

    it is optional as Spring Boot can often auto-detect the dialect based on the database driver in use.
